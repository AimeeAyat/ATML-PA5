# Model Card for reward_model_orca_output

This model is a fine-tuned version of [HuggingFaceTB/smollm2-135M-SFT-Only](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceTB/smollm2-135M-SFT-Only).
It has been trained using [TRL](https://github.com/huggingface/trl).

## Quick start

```python
from transformers import pipeline

text = "The capital of France is Paris."
rewarder = pipeline(model="None", device="cuda")
output = rewarder(text)[0]
print(output["score"])
```

## Training procedure

 


This model was trained with Reward.
